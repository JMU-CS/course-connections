# Course Connections Visualization

The graph-data.txt should contain a list of courses and their topic tags. A course is given by a line containing the course number followed by the course title, such as

CS 149 Intro to Programming

and then one or more topic tags, each on its own line beginning with a hashtag, like

#programming
#logic

etc. Finally, a blank line is used to separate courses.
